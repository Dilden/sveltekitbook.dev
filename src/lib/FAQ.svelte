        In the first part, you’ll be introduced to SvelteKit with a quick installation, followed up with the standard
        Hello, World! example we’ve all come to love and appreciate. This will help familiarize you with SvelteKit's
        project structure. It then goes on to lay some groundwork by exploring the various configuration options available to further
        customize a SvelteKit application. From there, it covers how SvelteKit leverages existing standards
        to deliver a small yet powerful framework.

      <p class='my-5'>
        In the second part, we learn why the developers of SvelteKit have made
        routing central to the framework. It examines some previously introduced routing techniques
        in more detail. This part then shows how SvelteKit moves data to Svelte components and accepts data from
        them through HTML form elements. Finally, you’ll see some more advanced routing techniques that
        promise to cover even the most obscure edge cases encountered in routing.

        Part three aims to cover the additional requisite concepts of SvelteKit. It begins by showing you how to
        produce a build for a production environment with resources showing how easily it can be done using
        SvelteKit’s adapter system. It then covers how hooks can be used to manipulate data flowing in and out
        of a SvelteKit application. From there, it addresses how to best import static assets by leveraging Vite.
        Then, it explains the various modules available in SvelteKit that make the entire framework possible.
        The section also covers how to ensure that a SvelteKit application can be made available to as many
        users as possible while boosting search engine rankings. Finally, it wraps up with various resources
        that will prove invaluable to any developer attempting to power their next project with SvelteKit.
